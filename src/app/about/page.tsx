                <p className="text-charcoal/70 mb-4">
                  I'm Edward Parker Stroop (Parker), filmmaker and retreat leader, with nearly a decade of experience across television, commercials, feature films, motorsports, and documentary follow projects. My approach to filmmaking is rooted in faith—creating what I call "R-rated Christian films" that don't shy away from the raw realities of life while maintaining a redemptive perspective.
                </p>
                <p className="text-charcoal/70">
                  I have a passion for merging creativity with calling, creating spaces where filmmakers can encounter God in their craft and develop work that carries both artistic excellence and eternal significance.

            <p className="text-charcoal/70 mb-4">
              The Born to Create Project is a Christian retreat where presence takes priority over performance, and Spirit-led creativity guides every frame. We believe in truth in storytelling—narratives that reflect God's heart and reveal His character through the fundamentals of documentary filmmaking. Here, excellence becomes worship as we steward our creative gifts with intentionality and skill.
            </p>
            <p className="text-charcoal/70">
              All are welcome to join this community where faith and filmmaking intersect. Our rhythm includes morning devotion and prayer, optional quiet hours for Scripture and reflection, testimony circles for sharing God's work in our lives, and worship and ministry nights that celebrate His faithfulness in our creative journey.

              To empower creatives to discover and share their unique voice through the art of filmmaking and storytelling. We believe that everyone has a story worth telling, and our retreat provides the tools, guidance, and community to bring those stories to life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-charcoal/70">
              We create a sacred space where creativity meets purpose, where technical skills merge with personal growth, and where individual expression contributes to collective inspiration.
